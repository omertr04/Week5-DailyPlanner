# Work Day Planner

This project was created as part of Assignment 5 for our coding course. The aim of the assignment was to build a simple daily planner where users can add important events and effectively manage their time.

## User Story

In this particular case we needed to build a simple daily planner where it would allow user to add important events to their daily schedule. To stay organised and manage tasks effectively 

## Functionality

The Work Day Planner as following the guidelines of the criteria given to us does as follows:

- Displays the current day at the top of the calendar so user can see which date it is
- Provides time blocks for standard business hours, starting from 9am to 5pm.
- Colors each time block to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future, making it easy to see what time it is.
- Allows you to enter events by simply clicking on a time block.
- Saves your entered events locally, so if you do refresh the page your inputs are still there for you to access
